# Week 1

Hello! We are entering the first week of our study group! This week we will focus on **Arrays**. We'll start with the basics and touch on many topics, and we'll solve LeetCode questions. Resources for Group 1 and Group 2 are listed below. I strongly recommend that Group 2 reviews the contents of Group 1, and Group 1 reviews the contents of Group 2. There are places on the internet where you can access the Java book. And remember, don't say "I don't know Java" :slight_smile: just trust the process.
