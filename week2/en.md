# Week 2

Hello! We're entering the second week of our study group! This week, we will be focusing on the Sliding Window technique and Stack (and also a bit on linked lists). Like last week, we have reading materials and videos to watch. Again, we have amazing Leetcode questions! I am personally incredibly excited to solve them. I'll leave the contents and questions below. Besides readings, videos, and Leetcode, we have a new topic this week; write it yourself.

The 'write it yourself' section will progress independently from Leetcode, where we will be creating our own data structures.

## Group 1

### Readings

- https://medium.com/basecs/stacks-and-overflows-dbcf7854dc67
- Data Structures and Algorithms in Java, Michael T. Goodrich (Chapter 3.2 - Singly Linked Lists p122-127)
- Data Structures and Algorithms in Java, Michael T. Goodrich (Chapter 6.1 - Stack, p226-p234) _recommend reading the entire section on Stack, but it's not mandatory_

### Videos

### Write It Yourself

- Write your own linked list! (If you're wondering what to do, you can look at the example we did live. The book in the readings also explains how to do it. :))
- Write your own Stack!

### LeetCode

- https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/
- https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/
- https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-parentheses/
- https://leetcode.com/problems/min-stack/

_The 'write it yourself' section is an extra task for group 2. If you're free and want to tackle it, you're welcome to do so :)_

_You can open a PR with your solutions under week2 with a folder named after your nickname. You can open a single PR for all your solutions; no need to open separate PRs for each question. Let's make a great repo!_
